# paddi_sourcecode

# Included is the original version of PADDI (created by Stephan Stellmach) and used primarily for studying double-diffusive convection 
# (includes fluid, chemical, and temperature fields). The updated version of PADDI (found in the second commit) now includes a particle 
# field adopting the two-fluid formalism (treating the particle field as a continuum). The modified version of PADDI now includes  
# particle momentum and particle concentration equations, with additional parameters such as the particle stopping time (diagnostic for 
# preferential clustering effect), particle diffusivity, particle mass loading, and particle stratification.
